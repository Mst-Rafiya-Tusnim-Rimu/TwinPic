# TwinPic
TwinPic is a very basic Photo and Video Gallery App.

Photo and video gallery apps are one of the most common apps that you can find on any Android device. Ever wondered how they are made? TwinPic is one of the best open-source gallery app you can try and learn from.

It is quite simple, easy to understand and is perfectly suitable for any beginner developer. One of the best things in this app is the way we have implemented dynamic theming. It is something that many Android developers have struggled to implement properly.

The best way to learn is to read and that’s true for a developer as well. If you want to become a better developer, you have to read more code. It’s as simple as that.

Books, blogs, forums are all good to a certain extent but there is nothing that can replace some fully-functional, exhaustive open-source projects where the entire app with all its resources is right in front of you.

All you have to do is sit back, take a cup of coffee and read some kick-ass code.
